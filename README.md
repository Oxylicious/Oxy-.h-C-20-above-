## ðŸ§© What is this?

`oxy++.h` is a custom header file that includes all the **essential STL headers**, **short-hand macros**, and **utility functions** so you can just drop it in and start coding.

- Clean syntax for `cout`, `cin`, `vector`, `map`, etc.
- Random utilities (`randi`, `randf`, `seedRand`)
- File I/O helpers (`readFile`, `writeFile`, `appendFile`)
- Time utilities (`nowTime`, `timeStr`)
- String conversion tools (`toString`, `fromString`)
- C++20 support (`<ranges>`, `<format>`, etc.)

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Drop `oxy++.h` into your project directory.
2. Include it in your code like a true rebel:

```cpp
#include "oxy++.h"
